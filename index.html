        <p>Rhapsodius is an artist whose boundary-crossing work defies convention. He is a singer, multi-instrumentalist, composer,<br>
            director, producer, playwright, educator, and activist. His work in diverse fields has included directing high-profile tributes <br>
            to icons Quincy Jones and Oscar Peterson, opening for Bobby McFerrin, and performing for Nelson Mandela - twice.<br>
            Deeply and equally schooled in the Western European Art music tradition and various branches of African Diasporic<br>
            music, Rhapsodies brings new sounds, images, and ideas into the space - that is everything you know and nothing you<br>
            recognize. Rhapsodius dedicates himself to creating art that intentionally edifies, provokes thought, discussion, and <br>
            dialogue, challenges conventions, and hopefully, inspires positive change in the world.<br></p>
