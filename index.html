        <div class="ttext">Rhapsodius is a confluence of things. Singer, multi-instrumentalist, composer, arranger, director, producer,<br> 
            playwright, educator, activist, and more. An artist whose boundary-crossing work defies convention. Rhapsodius<br> 
            has worked with artists in diverse fields, both in Canada and abroad. Deeply and equally schooled in the<br> 
            Western European Art music tradition and various branches of African Diasporic music, Rhapsodius brings new<br> 
            sounds, images, and ideas into the space - that are everything you know and nothing you recognize. Rhapsodius<br>
            dedicates himself to creating art that intentionally edifies, provokes thought, discussion, and dialogue,<br>
            challenges conventions, and hopefully, inspires positive change in the world.</div>
